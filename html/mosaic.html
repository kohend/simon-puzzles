<p>
The squares on the board can be marked black or white.
<p>
The clues tell you how many squares around the clue are black, <b>including</b> 
the square of the clue itself. 
<p>
A click does a step in the circle of modes: unmarked -> marked -> blank.
<p>
A right click (or a long press on Android) does two steps instead of one. 
<p>
Drag is supported, vertically and horizontally (diagonally is not), sets all unmarked
tiles to the the first tile state (according to the button). Right drag might not work
on touchscreens and touchpads.
<p>
The puzzle is guaranteed to be solvable, using single clues alone.
<p>
The game is also known as: ArtMosaico, Count and Darken, Cuenta Y Sombrea, Fill-a-Pix,
Fill-In, Komsu Karala, Magipic, Majipiku, Mosaico, Mosaik, Mozaiek, Nampre Puzzle, Nurie-Puzzle, Oekaki-Pix, Voisimage.
Implementation is loosely based on https://github.com/mordechaim/Mosaic

Aggressive is making sure that there are no spare clues, it takes a while to check, so it's disabled
in the 50x50 preset, you are welcome to use it, but keep in mind that 50x50 can take minutes to generate
and 100x100 can take over 30 minutes to generate, this may widely vary since it's random.
